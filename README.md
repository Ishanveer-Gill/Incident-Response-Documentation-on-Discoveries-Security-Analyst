## Introduction
During the Azure HoneyNet simulation, I took on the responsibility of a Cyber Incident Responder within my Security Operations Center (SOC), diligently investigating and resolving three security incidents. This document acts as a summary of my learning experience, demonstrating the effectiveness of the incident response procedures I deployed to mitigate possible threats.

## Scope
The document comprises overviews, evaluations of consequences, responsive measures, and categorizations (if relevant) for the incidents listed below:
- Incident ID: 2 - Brute Force ATTEMPT - MS SQL Server
- Incident ID: 3 - Malware Detected
- Incident ID: 4 - Possible Privilege Escalation (Azure Key Vault Critical Credential Retrieval or Update)
